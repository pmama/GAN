A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a deep learning architecture. It trains two neural networks to compete against each other to generate more authentic new data from a given training dataset. For instance, you can generate new images from an existing image database or original music from a database of songs.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently achieved impressive results in the field. Specifically, by incorporating two separate networks, generator and discriminator, GAN learns a loss function due to which it is able to produce highly realistic images.

- Generator an Dicriminator are two basic networks of GAN, that helps GAN learns a loss function due to which it is able to produce highly realistic image.
- Generators generates new unreal image. It generates new data by taking an input data sample and modifying it as much as possible.
- Discriminator helps discriminating the real and unreal image and at the same time it guides the generator to improve the generation skill.
